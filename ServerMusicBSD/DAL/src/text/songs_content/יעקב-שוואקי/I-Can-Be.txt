מילות השיר:

I am a child

And the road ahead is paved with possibility

Laughter and smiles...

When I'm with you I'm soaring high and free

 

When you're in my world

i believe in me

I look into your eyes and see that

 

I can be stronger

I can be braver

I can be, I can be anything

Anything I want to be

 

I have the power

I have the courage

I am a hero

Everything I need is inside of me

 

Life throws me fire

And fate will test me ten million ways

Sometimes I'm tired

It's hard to see the light of better days

 

But then I dare to dream

I find the hope for more

I reach for all you gave and see that

 

LIFE IS THE PEOPLE WE LOVE AND WHAT WE

GIVE TO ONE ANOTHER LOVING IS

GIVING, GIVING IS LIFE...

 

I am a Fighter

I am a dreamer

I am a hero

Everything i am... cause you believed in me.
